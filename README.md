# Default Free Subscription
Had created default subscription with Sudip
## Creating new Domain 
- By default when I login with my outlook email, at right hand corner it shows my email id. If I do for myself its Ok, but if I am going to create videos - that's not ok for me as it displays my email id.
- So, its better I should use a different domain - the way I did gogates domain while creating Active - Active cluster. If we check those videos, we had a seperate VM for it wherein I had installed Active Directory and Domain Services and then create a domain and added 2 users - magogate & dgogate.
- I will try to replicate same thing here in Azure. I don't need to install AD here, as its already available. So I did following.
1. After logging with my outlook account, I click on "All Services"

2. Then under Identity category - select "Azure Active Directory"
